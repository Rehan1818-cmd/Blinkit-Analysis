A Power BI project for Blinkit focuses on analyzing key business metrics to enhance operations, customer experience, and decision-making. The dashboard would track order analytics, including total orders, revenue, and cancellation trends, along with delivery performance metrics such as average delivery time, rider efficiency, and fulfillment rates. Customer insights like active users, retention rates, and purchasing patterns would help optimize engagement strategies. Additionally, inventory and supply chain management features would monitor stock levels, supplier performance, and wastage to ensure smooth operations. Financial metrics, including revenue, profit margins, and marketing ROI, would provide a comprehensive view of business health. Using Power BIâ€™s data integration, DAX calculations, and interactive visualizations, this project would enable Blinkit to improve operational efficiency, minimize delays, and make data-driven decisions in real time.
